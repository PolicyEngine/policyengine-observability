# policyengine-observability

Shared PolicyEngine observability runtime for fail-open local timings,
structured logs, OpenTelemetry traces, and OpenTelemetry metrics.

The package intentionally keeps framework support in adapters:

- `policyengine_observability.adapters.flask`
- `policyengine_observability.adapters.fastapi`
- `policyengine_observability.integrations.httpx`

OpenTelemetry imports are lazy. Timing and structured logging can run without
an OTel backend; exporting traces/metrics is opt-in through configuration.
